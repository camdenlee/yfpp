In 2010, along with <a href=\"#mo\" class=\"js-carouselNav-link\">Mo</a>, they put up this fucking site to great fucking success. This fucking guy also worked on this fucking project called the Voting Fucking Information Fucking Project, which, through the Google Fucking Civic Information API, helps power this fucking site. Jared currently runs his own fucking consultancy, The Turnout, where he can't swear as fucking much.",

This son-of-a-bitch hopped on the team in 2012 with an all-night development bender to finally add some CSS to the original fucking site. When he's not going above and beyond his civic-fucking-duty, Jay can be found noodling away on his goddamn guitar or hanging out with his lovely wife and his trusty side-kick, Buddy the Wonder Dog.",

In the winter of 2016, <a href=\"#jay\" class=\"js-carouselNav-link\">Jay</a>, and <a href=\"#jared\" class=\"js-carouselNav-link\">Jared</a> approached Josh to make YFPP \"not as shitty\" and Josh feels like he lived up to this request.
