In 2010, along with Mo [link to Mo's bio], they put up this fucking site to great fucking success. This fucking guy also worked on this fucking project called the Voting Fucking Information Fucking Project, which, through the Google Fucking Civic Information API, helps power this fucking site. Jared currently runs his own fucking consultancy, The Turnout, where he can't swear as fucking much.",

In the winter of 2016, Jason [Link to Jay's profile], Jared [link to Jared's profile], and Mo [link to Mo's profile] approached Josh to make YFPP \"not as shitty\" and Josh feels like he lived up to this request. When Josh isn't writing in the third person, he's crafting pretty pictures and  UI/UX for Bandzoogle, the world's best web platform for musicians.",
